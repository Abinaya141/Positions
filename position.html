      Front-end Development is the development or creation of a user interface
      using some markup languages and other tools. It is the development of the
      user side where only user interaction will be counted. It consists of the
      interface where buttons, texts, alignments, etc are involved and used by
      the user.

      Languages for Front-end development Front-end is the part that is
      accessible to the user only, It should be self-explanatory and must be
      user-friendly and designed. so to achieve this we have some basic
      languages which can be used to create interactive web pages. These are the
      basic needs for the creation of a web page. HTML: It was introduced in
      1993 and currently at version HTML5, is a foundational language for
      creating structured web content. It facilitates the creation of forms,
      tables, and structured data, essential for input elements and organizing
      information on web pages. HTMLâ€™s evolution continues to shape the internet
      by enabling developers to design interactive and accessible user
      interfaces across various platforms and devices. CSS: CSS, introduced on
      17 December 1996 and currently at version CSS3, stands for Cascading Style
      Sheets. It complements HTML by styling web pages, managing colors, and
      enabling the creation of responsive designs. CSS empowers web developers
      to enhance user interfaces, ensuring visually appealing and consistent
      layouts across different devices and screen sizes. JavaScript: ECMAScript,
      introduced on 4 December 1995 and currently at version ECMAScript 2022, is
      a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded programming language. It
      enables dynamic changes and event handling in web development.
